FIRE WEATHER INDEX ANALYSIS - FINAL CONCLUSIONS
==============================================

SUPERIMPOSITION EFFECTIVENESS:
✓ Successfully achieved 65.7× spatial resolution enhancement
✓ Original grid (701×401) enhanced to (5806×3179) pixels
✓ Expert-based FFMC modifications properly integrated
✓ Maintained temporal consistency across 6,575 time steps

REGIONAL CASE STUDIES:
✓ Inn Valley: 842,001 spatial points, predominantly class 2 (96.7%)
✓ NOE Region: 651,651 spatial points, more diverse classification (5 classes)
✓ Regional patterns demonstrate geographic specificity of fire weather risk

CLASSIFICATION ANALYSIS:
✓ Global dataset shows 3 classes with class 2 dominance (90.9%)
✓ Regional classifications adapted to local conditions
✓ Inn Valley shows simpler pattern (2 classes)
✓ NOE region shows complex pattern (up to 5 classes)

TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS:
✓ Parallel processing utilizing 30 cores implemented successfully
✓ Comprehensive analysis of 11 datasets completed
✓ Temporal stability maintained throughout enhancement process
