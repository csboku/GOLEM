KEY FINDINGS:
✓ This hotspot represents the densest fire area in the dataset
✓ Expert FFMC adjustments show consistent positive pattern
✓ 75 fires (27.3%) had risk classification upgraded
✓ Spatial coherence variable within 10km radius
✓ Local fire weather risk assessment enhanced through expert knowledge integration

VALIDATION CONCLUSION:
The FFMC superimposition technique demonstrates high effectiveness 
in this high-fire-density area, with meaningful adjustments to 159 fires 
(57.8%) and improved risk classification for 
75/275 fire events.
